# Star-Treker - plan your next adventure with this new travel planner app

## Project Mission
The goal was to build an application that helps users create their future trip. They can add thee location they want to travel to and set the dates for when they want to leave for their trip as well. The mission was to incorporate three APIs Pixabay, Weatherbit.io, and Geonames. The Star-Treker app will display the image of the location, date, and display the weather for destination. Once the information is obtained by the user, they can either print their trip or delete it and start over again.
